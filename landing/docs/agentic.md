# Agentic AI

Agentic AI empowers autonomous agents to integrate perception, planning, and action for reliable and safe execution of complex workflows.

## What you'll find here

- Pattern examples for retrieval-augmented planning and tool invocation
- Stateful orchestration with checkpoints, retries, and human approvals
- Integrations to enterprise systems for document processing and automation

## Design considerations

- Traceability and audit logs for agent decisions and actions
- Safe execution of side-effects with permissioning and rollbacks
- Monitoring, error handling, and observability for long-running agents

## Demos

- Claims automation: extract, validate, and route claims
- Document agent: ingest, query, and take prescribed actions
- Automation flows: orchestrate tasks across systems with retries and alerts
