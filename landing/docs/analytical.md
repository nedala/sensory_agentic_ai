# Analytical AI

Unlock insights from data with robust analytical AI. Powerful, production-ready approaches for structured data: forecasting, predictive scoring, and operational analytics. This section emphasizes reproducible machine learning (ML) pipelines and measurable business outcomes.

## What you'll find here

- End-to-end forecasting pipelines with backtesting and scenario generation
- Customer scoring and cohort analysis for retention and segmentation
- Hybrid search and analytics combining vector and keyword search for enterprise datasets

## Typical inputs & outputs

- Inputs: time-series, transactional tables, event logs, and derived features
- Outputs: point and probabilistic forecasts, scored records, feature importance tables, and diagnostic reports

## Production considerations

- Robust feature engineering and data validation (data drift, missingness)
- Proper backtesting, calibration, and model monitoring
- Explainability and model governance (feature attribution, audit logs)

## Demos

- Forecasting: backtest and scenario projection
- Churn modeling: scoring, cohorts, and lift analysis
- OmniSearch: hybrid semantic + keyword search for reports
